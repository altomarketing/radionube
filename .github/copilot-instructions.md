# Copilot instructions — radionube

- **Project type**: static marketing site (plain HTML/CSS/JS). There is no `package.json`, build script, or test harness in the repo — edits are applied directly to files served by a static web server or opened in a browser.

- **Key entry points**:
  - `index.html` — main Spanish site entry (hero, header/nav, content sections).
  - `index-en.html` — English entry (parallel structure to `index.html`).
  - `radio/index.html` and `radio-planes-de-streaming.html` — radio-specific pages.
  - `assets/css/style.css` and `assets/css/pricing.css` — main CSS files. Modify these for global style changes.
  - `assets/js/main.js` — primary site behavior (header scroll, mobile nav, carousel, isotope filtering, GLightbox, Swiper integrations). Use this file to change UI interactions.
  - `assets/img/` — canonical location for images used across pages.

- **Vendor libraries** (pre-bundled under `assets/vendor/`): Bootstrap, Swiper, GLightbox, Isotope, Waypoints, animate.css, boxicons, bootstrap-icons and others. Do not add new CDN includes unless necessary; prefer adding files under `assets/vendor/` to keep consistency.

- **Patterns & conventions** (concrete examples):
  - Navigation: header markup uses `#header`, `#navbar` and toggles `navbar-mobile` class. See `assets/js/main.js` mobile nav toggle (it flips `.bi-list` / `.bi-x`).
  - Hero carousel: `#heroCarousel` and indicators are generated by `assets/js/main.js` (look for `heroCarouselIndicators`).
  - Portfolio filtering: look for `.portfolio-container` and `#portfolio-flters` which wire into Isotope in `assets/js/main.js`.
  - Lightboxes/sliders: GLightbox is initialized with selector `.portfolio-lightbox`; portfolio details use Swiper (`.portfolio-details-slider`). If changing markup, keep these classes/attributes so the JS finds elements.
  - CSS: `assets/css/style.css` contains the bulk of styling; small page-specific inline styles appear inside some HTML pages (e.g., `index.html` has <style> blocks). Prefer central changes in `style.css` when possible.

- **Language/locale files**: The repo contains parallel pages (`index.html` vs `index-en.html`, `contacto.html` vs `contact.html`, `precios.html` vs `pricing.html`). Keep content parallel when adding features — add matching files for each language if you change structure or new sections.

- **SCSS status**: `assets/scss/Readme.txt` notes the Sass sources are part of a pro theme — they are not present here. Do not search for `.scss` build steps; modify `assets/css/*.css` instead.

- **When changing JavaScript behavior**:
  - Edit `assets/js/main.js`. The file contains small helper functions `select`, `on`, `onscroll` — follow that helper pattern to add listeners.
  - Preserve existing selectors and class names (see above) to avoid breaking vendor hook-ups (Isotope/GLightbox/Swiper/Waypoints).

- **Adding assets**:
  - Images: place under `assets/img/` (create subfolders if helpful). Update references in HTML/CSS to the relative `assets/img/...` path.
  - CSS/JS vendor files: add under `assets/vendor/<lib>/` and link from the HTML pages similar to existing includes in `index.html`.

- **Preview / developer workflow**:
  - There is no repo-level build. Preview changes by opening the HTML files in a browser or using a static server (e.g., `python3 -m http.server` from repo root). Keep edits small and verify on both `index.html` and `index-en.html` for parity.

- **Common small tasks & examples**:
  - Change header background color: update `#header` rule in `assets/css/style.css` (search for `#header {`).
  - Change mobile menu behavior: edit the mobile toggle block in `assets/js/main.js` (search for `Mobile nav toggle`).
  - Add a new site page: copy an existing page (for example `portfolio.html`), update content, add a nav entry in the header (`index.html` and `index-en.html`) and test both languages.

- **Integration points / external services**:
  - The site includes an external YouTube embed (example in `index.html`) and references `UptimeRobot` in content. There are no automatic deployments or CI configs in the repo — any deployment steps are external to this repo.

- **What not to assume**:
  - There is no Node/npm build pipeline or tests in this repository. Do not add code that requires a non-existent build step unless you add clear instructions and the associated manifest files (e.g., `package.json`).
  - SCSS sources are missing; do not attempt to compile Sass here.

If anything in these notes is unclear or you want more examples (e.g., a short checklist for editing language pages or adding/swapping a vendor library), tell me which area to expand and I will update this file.
